# Fr_nkenstien
**Fr_nkenstien** is an umbrella project with an (`over`)ambitious hope to create an `Responsive Open Source AI` System.

**Fr_nkenstien** would be based on the following Open Source Systems 
- [Apache OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org/) {`Fr_nkNLP`}: The module would be used to reading and understanding the incoming sentences and understand the data from the sentences
    - Names
    - Organizations
    - Places
    - Currencies
    - Times and Dates
    - Sentiment Analysis
    - Other Analytics
- [Apache Nutch](http://nutch.apache.org/): Open Source Web Crawler to search for topics and gather details to aquire knowledge
- [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/): To understand data from provided Documents and index them
- [Elastic Search](http://www.elastic.co/): Search indexed Memory for knowledge
- [Kibana](http://www.elastic.co/): Reporting to get Admin UI
- [neo4j](https://neo4j.com/): Memory for 'Fr_nkenstien'
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): Secondary Memory
- [Spring Data REST](http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-rest/): REST API Connections for Databases
- [ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/): for Node Management and Availability
- [Drools](http://www.drools.org/): Descision making and workflow maintenance
- [Apache Synape](http://synapse.apache.org/): Service Integrations of all Micro Services

`Fr_nkenstien` is still in a `zygote` form. A lot of work is to be done on the same to be able to come anywhere near realtime.

Contributions appreciated.
