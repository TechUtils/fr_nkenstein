# Fr_nkenstien
**Fr_nkenstien** is an umbrella project with an (`over`)ambitious hope to create an `Responsive Open Source AI` System.

**Fr_nkenstien** would be based on the following Open Source Systems 
- Apache OpenNLP(`Fr_nkNLP`): The module would be used to reading and understanding the incoming sentences and understand the data from the sentences
    - Names
    - Organizations
    - Places
    - Currencies
    - Times and Dates
    - Sentiment Analysis
    - Other Analytics
- Apache Nutch: Open Source Web Crawler to search for topics and gather details to aquire knowledge
- Apache Tika: To understand data from provided Documents and index them
- Elastic Search: Search indexed Memory for knowledge
- Kibana: Reporting to get Admin UI
- Neo4j: Memory for 'Fr_nkenstien'
- MongoDB: Secondary Memory
- Spring Data REST: REST API Connections for Databases
- ZooKeeper: for Node Management and Availability

`Fr_nkenstien` is still in a `zygote` form. A lot of work is to be done on the same to be able to come anywhere near realtime.

Contributions appreciated.
